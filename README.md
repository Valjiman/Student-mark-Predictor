## Project Overview

The **Student Marks Predictor** is a machine learning project that predicts a student's marks based on the number of hours they study. It uses a simple linear regression model to find the relationship between study hours and marks scored, helping students understand how studying for different durations might impact their scores.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of two columns:
- **Hours**: Number of hours a student studies.
- **Scores**: The marks scored by the student.

This data is fed into a linear regression model to predict the relationship between hours studied and the marks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language used for model training and predictions.
- **Flask**: Web framework used to create the web interface for the model.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the user interface of the web application.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for model creation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library for handling the dataset.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting graphs.

## Model Training

The model is trained using the **Linear Regression** algorithm. The relationship between hours studied and marks scored is modeled with the formula:

```
Predicted Score = m * Hours + b
```

Where `m` is the slope and `b` is the intercept. The model is trained on historical data of hours and scores, allowing it to make predictions based on new data.

## How to Use the Predictor

1. Enter the number of hours you plan to study into the input box.
2. Click on the "Predict" button.
3. The model will predict the likely marks you will score based on the hours you entered.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-marks-predictor.git
cd student-marks-predictor
```

### Step 2: Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Train the model (if needed)

If you want to train the model from scratch, run the following:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Step 4: Run the Flask App

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the web application. You can access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Step 5: Test the Web Application

Once the app is running, you can input the number of hours and get a prediction on the marks.
